# grain-lit-element
Experimental usage of [lit-html](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/lit-html) in polymer 2.

## Overview

For an example code see https://github.com/daKmoR/grain-lit-element/blob/master/demo/grain-lit-element-example.html

## Limitations/Concerns

- only uses PropertyAccessor (so no polymer properties, observers, ...)
- PropertyEffects seems to be not easyily integrated (and to be honest PropertyEffects is a way too big beast - would be nice to use only parts of it)
- Path forward still unclear
